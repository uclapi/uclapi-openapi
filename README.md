# UCL API OpenAPI

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for the [UCL API](https://uclapi.com). The [`uclapi.json`](./uclapi.json) specification file **should not** be manually edited unless via Swagger Hub.

## The aim

The aim is to set up repositories containing various client SDKs in different languages, automatically generated and maintained via our OpenAPI specification.

## Current progress on auto updates

A JavaScript client SDK is automatically generated on pushed to `master`. These are then automatically pushed to the [`uclapi-js-sdk`](https://github.com/uclapi/uclapi-js-sdk) repository on GitHub.
